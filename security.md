# Security

## CIA Triad

The CIA triad: fundamental model in cybersecurity. Guiding principal for data and application security.

- Confidentiality (do encryption at rest, check user access)
- Integrity (avoid data tempering, avoid ransomware)
- Availability (avoid DDoS and avoid downtime)

## Store data securely

Hash + salt + do repeat hashes so that it takes time to find even one password ==> Complicated to do brute force because it takes very long. Doing multiple hashes is called streching.
