# Visualizations

## Criteria

In order to create efficient dashboard, try to think about:

- Data literacy of public (will he understand complicated figures or not?)
- Effects or causes? My public has some things he can control and others he must accept. Which information should I present as given?
- Goal: exploration or decision making? Do I try to simplify the information or present nuances?
- Experience level

## Careful with divergence

Most dashboard start with a meeting. This is when you realize that there are different metrics asked and that they all tap in different data sources. Instead of trying to create a dashboard that tries to satisfy everybody, the first step is aligning user expectations.
